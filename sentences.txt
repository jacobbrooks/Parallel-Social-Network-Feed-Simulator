24
I hate my life
I'm having the worst day ever
I have no friends
My dreams usually involve me sucking in general
Everyone but me is stupid
Me doing poorly in school is due to my teacher's thick Russian accent
My dad disowned me
I can't sleep
I'm incapable of self reflection, except for right now but that's it
corporations have a stranglehold on our government
college is a giant sham to make you buy textbooks
The government is mind-controlling me except for right now
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously, especially for me because I don't have any
If I lost money like I lost friends, I'd be filing for chapter 13 bankruptcy
I am completely worthless
I am dumb
People should really learn how to speak correctibly
A rabbi, a priest and a nun walk into a bar, they see me hitting on an 80 year old bartender
If self-doubt was a liquid, I'd be constantly drowning
How many lightbulbs would it take to screw me, not many because everyone screws me
I'm the kind of person that always has gross earwax
My doctor diagnosed me with chronic existence 
The entire universe is expanding accept for my social circle
When the garbage truck comes around, I always hitch a ride in the back
